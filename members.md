**Bio:**
I am working in the Nuclear Physics Group at the University of Manchester. My project is to measure neutron occupancies in neutrinoless double beta decay canditate nuclei, using direct reaction spectroscopy. Should neutrinoless beta decay be observed, these occupancies are important for calculating the neutrino mass - they inform model choices. Calculating these occupancies requires measuring cross sections for many states. Creating a program for automatically fitting transfer reaction spectra to extract cross-sections is one project I am interested in. Another long-term goal is to improve the process of choosing optical model potentials. This will ameliorate the model dependency of the extracted relative cross-sections.
